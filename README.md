# clearify

##Inspiration

We were inspired by the growing need for more objective and unbiased language in digital communications. With the increasing use of text-based communication, it is more important than ever to remove any biases that may be present in our writing. Our team saw an opportunity to develop a Chrome extension that helps individuals communicate more clearly and effectively.

##What it does

Clearify is a Chrome extension that uses natural language processing to detect and highlight biased language in sentences. The extension suggests alternative words or phrases that can be used to remove the bias, allowing users to express themselves more objectively and with greater clarity. It can be used both when writing original content or reading online material.

##How we built it

We built Clearify using JavaScript and the GPT-3 Natural Language API. The extension is designed to work seamlessly with the Chrome browser, with a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to highlight and replace biased language in real-time.

##Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges we faced was training the natural language processing model to detect and highlight biased language accurately. For example, it misbehaved for non-biased language and non prompts. We also had to ensure that the extension was compatible with different versions of the Chrome browser.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of creating an effective solution that addresses an important issue in today's digital communication. We were able to build a functional and easy-to-use extension that helps users communicate more clearly and effectively, which we believe will have a positive impact on the online community.

##What we learned

Throughout the hackathon, we learned how to effectively use natural language processing to detect biased language, as well as how to build a functional Chrome extension from scratch. 

##What's next for Clearify

In the future, we plan to expand the functionality of Clearify to include additional features, such as suggestions for tone and voice, grammar correction, and translation services. We also plan to improve the accuracy of the natural language processing model and continue to refine the user interface for a seamless user experience.
